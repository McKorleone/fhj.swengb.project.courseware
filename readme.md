### 1. Courseware App

Our Courseware App provides CRUD functionality.
The project contains multiple database tables.
We use Student, Homework, Exam, Course, Lecture, and Project as tables.

The whole navigation through the Courseware App takes place on an easy to use interface after the start of the application.
For each entry that will be made on any table the Courseware App has the functionality of checking the user input.
The user input will be checked if a user makes an update or creates an entry in the table.
Another feature of the Courseware App is that each entry for itself can be deleted or updated.

If a user wants to export the data of a table he can use that function at every table.
The created file will be exported as a .csv file.
